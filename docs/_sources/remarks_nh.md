# Interpretation
In the time period from 4 until 2 weeks before the SSW onset the zonal wind is more westerly (eastward) than normal (in the mean for the certain calendar day) at the station on the northern hemisphere. This could be the upper edge of the intensified jetstream between stratosphere and mesosphere, which is typical in the time before SSWs. In the datasets it is best pronounced at CMOR meteor radar.<br>
In the time period around the SSW onset latitudinal differences in the zonal wind component can be seen. The stations at lower latitudes, i.e. Collm, Juliusruh and CMOR, show a maximum of the zonal wind reverse around 3-5 days after the SSW onset. At higher latitudes (Kiruna, Andenes, Sodankyla and their combined datasets) the decrease of zonal wind speed and reverse to easterly direction is already apparent a few days earlier, that is, around the SSW onset.<br>
This observation corresponds to the planetary wave (PW) activity, which is enhanced earlier for Kiruna etc. and later for Collm etc. This leads to the assumption that latitudinal differences are apparent in the PW activity as well.<br>
At Collm and Juliusruh there is also a strong increase in zonal wind speed around one week before the onset of the SSWs. It is apparent in altitudes from 80 to 90 km. This signature is not found at Kiruna and the other stations at higher latitudes, where the decrease of zonal wind speed has already started in this altitude range at this time. This decrease corresponds to an increased PW activity below and up to 80 km altitude around 12 days before the SSW onset, which can be seen at Collm and Juliusruh as well. But at these two stations it is followed by an even stronger increase in PW activity in around 80 to 90 km altitude around one week before the SSW onset. With weaker intensity this enhanced PW activity reaches even up to 100 km. This corresponds to the zonal wind increase during this time mentioned above. Possibly these two proceses superpose but the later one is stronger in 80 to 90 km altitude and therefore overpowers at Collm and Juliusruh so that this feature can be seen. Whether the zonal wind increase triggers the planetary wave activity or vice-versa is not yet clear and further investigations have to be made. Maybe the analysis of the GW drag instead of the GW activity could be an option for the future.<br>
In the weeks after the SSW onset the zonal wind reverses to westerly directions again in altitudes up to 85 km. The strongest increase in the zonal wind component can be found around 2 weeks after the SSW onset. This is very well pronounced at Collm and Juliusruh where the zonal wind increase corresponds to an strong increase in PW activity. This observed zonal wind increase is a phenomenon known as the re-establishment of the stratopause, which often takes place in altitudes between 75 and 85 km some weeks after an SSW event.<br>

Concerning gravity waves the stations on the northern hemisphere show in general an increased level of GW kinetic energy before and around - some stations even short time after - the onset of the SSWs. Especially during the time period of 3-6 weeks before the SSW onset the radar observations show as well increased values of total GW kinetic energy as strongly positive anomalies in an altitude range from 85 to 95 km. This is best pronounced at Juliusruh, Kiruna and Andenes. The positive anomalies after the SSW onset are weaker in magnitude and of less vertical extent.<br>
The reason for the enhanced level of GW kinetic energy some weeks before the SSW onset could be the jetstream, which intensifies typically before the beginning of an SSW event. Because of the increased wind speed the GW filtering is changed in that way, that more waves with larger positive phase speeds are filtered and canâ€™t propagate further upward to the mesosphere. As a result there are less GWs with positive phase speed in the mesosphere. Because of that, the GWs with negative phase speed predominate even more than normal. Thus the zonal GW component (which is defined as the difference between the positive and negative zonal GW components) becomes absolute more negative (according to amount greater). Hence the total kinetic energy of GWs increases. This leads to the observed enhanced GW activity in higher altitudes (here: 85 to 95 km).
