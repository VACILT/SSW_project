# Interpretation
At the radar station at Rio Grande in Argentina the zonal wind speeds tend to decrease in magnitude (in both directions) after the onset of the SSWs. The easterlies in around 80 km altitude become less easterly and the westerlies between 90 and 100 km become less westerly. The mesospheric change in around 80 km altitude is exactly the zonal wind decrease which is expected by the theory of inter-hemispheric coupling. But all in all the winds are still stronger than in the climatological mean for the corresponding calendar day as the anomalies of the zonal wind show.<br>
Remarkable is the strong PW activity in 85 to 95 km altitude around the SSW onset, which corresponds to a zonal wind increase in the same altitude range. Considering the SSW events individually, both can only be found for half of the events (2 out of 4).<br>
The meridional wind component shows multi-day fluctuations appearing as stripes, which decrease in magnitude with the SSW onset. These may indicate a quasi-multiday wave propagation. To identify a possible periodicity further investigation needs to be accomplished. Again, these quasi-two-day-fluctuations in the meridional wind component only appeared in the analysis of one of the events around 3 to 1 week before the SSW onset.<br>
Around 10 days after the SSW onset the meridional wind reverses to a southward direction. This reversal is associated with the negative anomalies in the meridional wind component which were expected by the inter-hemispheric coupling theory as well.<br>

At Davis these inter-hemispheric coupling impacts are less pronounced. There are only very slight changes in the zonal wind component and the anomalies are of small magnitude. In general, Davis shows the least changes of the 5 stations. This seems logic as it is situated in the Antarctic and therefore is the southernmost station with the greatest distance to the northern hemispheric polar vortex where the SSW events occur.<br>

The findings according to the anomalies of GW kinetic energy at Davis and Rio Grande seem to be consistent with the theoretical expectation from the inter-hemispheric coupling theory. One can see negative anomalies in around 90 km altitude before or around SSW events and positive anomalies below. This enhanced GW activity (compared to the climatological mean) - initially reaching up to 85 km - is also travelling downward with time (especially after the SSW onset), which agrees with the downward shift of GW drag stated by KÃ¶rnich and Becker (2010) as a result of inter-hemispheric coupling. The decreasing kinetic energy of GWs in the upper mesosphere around the SSW onset is visible in the climatology plot as well. Especially at Davis this is well pronounced.<br>
This agreement with the theory is an advance compared to the study of Yasui et al. (2016) as their obtained results were inconsistent with the inter-hemispheric coupling hypothesis.
