# Interpretation
At the radar station at Rio Grande in Argentina the zonal wind speeds tend to decrease in magnitude (in both directions) after the onset of the SSWs. The easterlies in around 80 km altitude become less easterly and the westerlies between 90 and 100 km become less westerly. The mesospheric change in around 80 km altitude is exactly the zonal wind decrease which is expected by the theory of inter-hemispheric coupling. But all in all the winds are still stronger than in the climatological mean for the corresponding calendar day as the anomalies of the zonal wind show.<br>
Remarkable is the strong PW activity in 85 to 95 km altitude around the SSW onset, which corresponds to a zonal wind increase in the same altitude range.<br>
The meridional wind component shows multi-day fluctuations appearing as stripes, which decrease in magnitude with the SSW onset. And around 10 days after the SSW onset the meridional wind reverses to a southward direction. This reversal is associated with the negative anomalies in the meridional wind component which were expected by the inter-hemispheric coupling theory as well.<br>

At Davis these inter-hemispheric coupling impacts are less pronounced. There are only very slight changes in the zonal wind component and the anomalies are of small magnitude. In general, Davis shows the least changes of the 5 stations. This seems logic as it is situated in the Antarctic and therefore is the southernmost station with the greatest distance to the northern hemispheric polar vortex where the SSW events occur.
