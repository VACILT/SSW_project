# SSW (student) project

See this website: [https://vacilt.github.io/SSW_project/intro.html](https://vacilt.github.io/SSW_project/intro.html).

## Methodology
### Superposed epoch analysis
The average meteorological conditions during SSW events should be characterized in this
project. Thus, this project does not aim to investigate the differences between individual
events. It rather concentrates on the mean perturbations to be expected during an "average"
SSW event.

Therefore a method which is called "superposed epoch analysis" (sometimes known as compos-
ite analysis as well) was used. At that the data from each event are ordered with reference to
the so-called "epoch time" (Denton et al., 2019). In this case this is the time of the SSW onset.
These ordered data were then averaged over all considered SSW events in order to receive the
average conditions. These were then plotted for a time period from 30 days before to 30 days
after the SSW onset. The dates at which SSW events occured were extracted from Denton
et al. (2019) and King et al. (2019).

To investigate anomalies as well, the deviation relative to the climatologies for the same calendar
day was derived.
